            <p>Many of our loved ones may not be able to go to hospitals on their own 
                or may not have anyone to take them. You might not be able to travel 
                all the way from America to accompany them.  Our program provides your 
                loved ones with hospital assistance services when you are outside your 
                home country and also give you daily updates on the progress.
